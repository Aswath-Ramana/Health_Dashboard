    > **Disclaimer**: This analysis is generated by AI and should not be considered as a replacement for professional medical advice. Please consult with a healthcare provider for proper medical diagnosis and treatment.

    ### AI Generated Parameter Evaluation:

    Organize the findings into three sections: **What is good**, **Be Alert!**, and **Need to check!**. For each section, write a short, human-readable summary (not a parameter list) that highlights the most important findings from the report. Each summary should be concise and focus on the overall health status reflected by the parameters in that category.

    - **What is good:** Summarize the positive findings and parameters within normal range.
    - **Be Alert!:** Summarize any findings that are outside the normal range and may require attention or monitoring.
    - **Need to check!:** Summarize any findings that are significantly abnormal and may need immediate medical attention.

    Example format:

    **What is good**
    The majority of your blood parameters, including hemoglobin and liver enzymes, are within normal limits, indicating good overall health.

    **Be Alert!**
    Your cholesterol level is slightly elevated, and your white blood cell count is just above the normal range. These may require monitoring and lifestyle adjustments.

    **Need to check!**
    Your blood sugar is significantly high, which could indicate diabetes and requires prompt medical evaluation.

    Only include summaries for these categories. Do not include a table, parameter lists, or recommendations. Focus on clear, concise, and human-friendly summaries under each section.
